<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a Symfony bundle that gives you information about the (un)used routes in your application.
With this information you can safely delete the unused routes from your code.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

Make sure Composer is installed globally, as explained in the
[installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

### Applications that use Symfony Flex

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute:

```console
$ composer require orbeji/unused-routes
```

### Applications that don't use Symfony Flex

#### Step 1: Download the Bundle

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
$ composer require orbeji/unused-routes
```

#### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `config/bundles.php` file of your project:

```php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    Orbeji\UnusedRoutes\UnusedRoutesBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After the installation the bundle will start registering the users activity.
This activity will be stored by default in a file in `%kernel.logs_dir%/accessed_routes{Ymd}.log`

To know which routes are unused execute the following command:
```bash
php bin/console unused-routes:list
```
This will show a table like this:
```bash
---------------------- ------- ------------- 
  Route                  #Uses   Last access  
 ---------------------- ------- ------------- 
  ux_live_component      0       -            
  admin_index            0       -            
  admin_post_index       0       -            
  admin_post_new         0       -            
  admin_post_show        0       -            
  admin_post_edit        0       -            
  admin_post_delete      0       -            
  blog_rss               0       -            
  blog_index_paginated   0       -            
  blog_post              0       -            
  comment_new            0       -            
  blog_search            0       -            
  security_login         0       -            
  user_edit              0       -            
  user_change_password   0       -            
 ---------------------- ------- -------------
 ```

Also you can pass the option `--show-all-routes` to add the info of the used routes
```bash
php bin/console unused-routes:list --show-all-routes
```
This will show a table like this:
```
---------------------- ------- ------------- 
  Route                  #Uses   Last access  
 ---------------------- ------- ------------- 
  ux_live_component      0       -            
  homepage               4       16/01/2024   
  admin_index            0       -            
  admin_post_index       0       -            
  admin_post_new         0       -            
  admin_post_show        0       -            
  admin_post_edit        0       -            
  admin_post_delete      0       -            
  blog_index             1       06/01/2024   
  blog_rss               0       -            
  blog_index_paginated   0       -            
  blog_post              0       -            
  comment_new            0       -            
  blog_search            0       -            
  security_login         0       -            
  user_edit              0       -            
  user_change_password   0       -            
 ---------------------- ------- -------------
 ```
Now the routes that have been accessed also appear here with some info of the number of acceses and the date of the last one.

### Configuration
There are only two parameters in this bundle. The path where the file is stores and the filename.
```yaml
unused_routes:
  file_path: '%kernel.logs_dir%'
  file_name: 'accessed_routes.log'
```
### Replacing how logs are stored/read 
If you want to replace the way of storing logs like using a database or another storaging strategy you can create your own service implementing the following interface:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Orbeji\UnusedRoutes\Provider;

use Orbeji\UnusedRoutes\Entity\UsedRoute;

interface UsageRouteProviderInterface
{
    /**
     * Everytime a user accesses a route this method is called to store this usage
     */
    public function addRoute(UsedRoute $route): void;

    /**
     * This method aggregates all UsedRoutes by the used route and sums all visits, leaving the timestamp of the last
     * visit
     * @return UsedRoute[]
     */
    public function getRoutesUsage(): array;
}
```
Then you should add this to your services.yaml

```yaml
services:
  Orbeji\UnusedRoutes\Provider\UsageRouteProviderInterface: '@your_own_service'
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Write a log file per day
- [x] Add tests
- [x] Add pipelines
  - [x] Check style
  - [x] Run Tests
  - [x] Coverage check
  - [x] Phpstan
- [x] Improve Readme with description and usage
- [ ] Multiple routes can be assigned to the same action, take this into account in the result table
- [ ] See if it's possible/worth it to autogenerate a bundle config file when installing
- [ ] Add more methods to store/read logs
- [ ] Add configuration to replace how we store/read logs
